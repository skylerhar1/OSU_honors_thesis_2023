# Assembly pipeline
# Redundans assembly
This is the assembly pipeline. First we generated a redundans assembly using illumina and low coverage nanopore reads. Details for  that assembly can be found here https://github.com/SpataforaLab/Rhizopogon_assembly/blob/master/Using%20heterozygous%20assemblers.md
# HI-C assembly
The HI-C assembly was performed by Phase genomics
# Gap closed assembly

> ./gap_closer.sh

# Basic Genome Statisticcs
